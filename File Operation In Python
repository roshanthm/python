Reading a Whole File
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()

Creating and Writing to a File
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello.\n')
    file.write('How are you.\n')
    file.write('I am good.\n')
    file.write('Krish is my name.\n')
    file.write('Welcome to the course.\n')

Reading a File Line by Line
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)


When reading line by line, new line characters are included. To remove them, use the .strip() method.
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())


Writing to a File and Overwriting
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello World\n')
    file.write('This is a new line\n')

Writing Multiple Lines to a File
lines = ['This is my first line\n', 'Second line\n', 'Third line\n']
with open('example.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.writelines(lines)

Working with Binary Files
Binary files, such as those with a .bin extension, are handled using binary modes. To write to a binary file, use 'wb' mode. To read from a binary file, use 'rb' mode.
with open('example.bin', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(b'Hello world')

with open('example.bin', 'rb') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

Copying Content from One File to Another
with open('example.txt', 'r') as source_file:
    content = source_file.read()
with open('destination.txt', 'w') as destination_file:
    destination_file.write(content)

Counting Lines, Words, and Characters in a File
def count_file_stats(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
        num_lines = len(lines)
        num_words = sum(len(line.split()) for line in lines)
        num_chars = sum(len(line) for line in lines)
    return num_lines, num_words, num_chars


Reading and Writing in the Same File Session
with open('example.txt', 'w+') as file:
    file.write('Hello world\n')
    file.write('This is a new line\n')
    file.seek(0)
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
